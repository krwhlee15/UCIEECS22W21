TicTacWowWeeWow.c

TicTacWowWeeWow.c is a "tic-tac-toe" game with features added.
It can be played by two people, or one person against PC.
There are 4 AIs available to play against, Inky, Blinky, Pinky, Clyde.
Inky picks first available move on the board.
Blinky picks a random available move.
Pinky blocks the player from getting 3 in a row when possible.
Clyde uses full tree search to find the best move.
The player is set to play as player 1.
In game settings, you can modify the character and color of player 1 and 2.
The default character is X for player 1, O for player 2, and the default color is 'default'.
Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow is available to choose.
Available colors are Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, and Default.
If there is no more empty space in the game, it ends up as a draw.
If the player gets the whole row, that player wins. 
The program checks whether the new move is a winning move, by checking whether the new move satisfies the winning requirement.
By receiving the new move that player made as an input, it checks row, column, diagonal, and reverse diagonal to see whether it satisfies the requirement.
After each move, player can choose whether to take back their move.
After the game against AI, player can choose to save a replay of the game in separate text file.

I feel like I finished more than 80 percent of the assignment. 
It would have been nice if I could make Clyde AI using dynamic struct, but I couldn't figure it out how.
I implemented using minimax method using recursion, without using dynamic struct and linked list.
