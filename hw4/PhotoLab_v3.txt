PhotoLab_v1

PhotoLab_v2 is a progarm that modifies a loaded image in many ways.
Currently there are six modifications available: aging, sharpen, edge detection, noise filter, posterizing, and negative filter.
Unlike PhotoLab_v1, the program has been separated into header files.
The files can be compiled at once through makefile. 
I'm quite confident with the assignment for now since it does all the things as I meant.
I feel like I completed at least 90% of the assignment.
