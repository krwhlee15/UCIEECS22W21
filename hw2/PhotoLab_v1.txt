PhotoLab_v1

PhotoLab_v1 is a progarm that modifies a loaded image in many ways.
Currently there are three modifications available: aging, sharpen, and edge detection.
I wrote an extra function called Adjust, makes sure that all the modified pixels are in bound.
I'm quite confident with the assignment for now since it does all the things as I meant.
I feel like I completed at least 90% of the assignment.
